### Presentation
My name is Ida and I am a .NET developer student at IT-HÃ¶gskolan i Gothenburg.   
I'm currently learning C#, webb-development, API- and database management, among other fun skills! 

### About me
I live with two cats and my partner. At my non-coding freetime I spend either spend time in the nature, renovating my van or working out. Before my studies to become a full time developer I have worked at social service as socialsekreterare.
